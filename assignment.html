                    <h2>What are Semantics in HTML?</h2>
                    <p>Semantics in web development refers to the practice of using HTML tags that carry meaningful names and describe the
                    content they contain. Instead of relying on generic elements, semantic tags clearly reflect the type of content they
                    represent.</p>

                    <p>For example, tags like "article," "header," "footer," and "section" are designed to describe specific types of content
                    or sections of a page. This helps both search engines and screen readers better understand the structure and meaning of
                    the content, resulting in more accessible and organized web pages.</p>

                    <h2>Why are Semantics important to HTML?</h2>
                    <center>
                        <h4>Improved Accesibility</h4>
                        <p>Semantic HTML ensures that assistive technologies, such as screen readers, can accurately interpret the structure and meaning of the content on a webpage. This is especially important for users with disabilities who rely on these tools to navigate and understand web pages.</p>
                        <h4>Better Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h4>
                        <p>Search engines use the structure of your HTML to determine the relevance and context of your content. By using semantic tags that clearly define sections, headings, and articles, you improve your page's ability to be indexed and ranked appropriately, which can help increase visibiliy in search results.</p>
                        <h4>Easier Maintenance and Collaboration</h4>
                        <p>Semantic HTML makes your code easier to read and maintain. When developers use descriptive tags, they provide a clearer understanding of the content’s role within the webpage, making it simpler to collaborate and maintain the codebase over time.</p>
                        <h4>Enhanced User Experience</h4>
                        <p>Well-structured, semantic HTML helps browsers display content consistently and provides users with an easier way to navigate the page. Whether users are on mobile or desktop devices, semantic tags help ensure that the page is organized in a user-friendly way.</p>

                    <h3>Examples of Semantics</h3>
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Header</li>
                            <p>Defines the introductory content of a page or section, which may include navigation links, logos, or the site’s title.</p>
                            <li>Article</li>
                            <p>Designed for content that stands alone, such as a blog post, news article, or individual piece of content that could be distributed independently.</p>
                            <li>Section</li>
                            <p>Defines a thematic grouping of content, often with its own heading. It helps to organize the webpage into logical sections.</p>
                            <li>Footer</li>
                            <p>Defines the footer area of a page or section, which typically includes copyright information, legal notices, or contact
                            details.</p>
                            <li>Nav</li>
                            <p>Groups together navigational links, making it easier for both users and search engines to identify navigation areas within the page.</p>
